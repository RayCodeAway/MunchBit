### Overview

We want to deliver a platform to take on the giants that are JustEat and UberEat.  we do this by using the blockchain ledger to perform transaction at scale without lag. Currently Business are at the mercy of these giants paying extortionate operating fees only to line the pockets of giant corps and eat into the little profits the restaurants work with.   

We want to deliver a solution for both clients and eaters that offer a cheaper alternative. With the blockchain always on customers both eaters and clients wont have issues with server outages and costs of operating will be at a marginal cost we are lookign at a number of smart contract blockchains such as Substrate, Komodo, Blockchain Smart Coin, Cardano, Solano 



### Project Details 

IPFS storage will be explored for client branding, which will translate to clients paying for storage of their assets. assets being images and other files.

Look out for the following:
* Mockups/designs of any UI components
* API specifications of the core functionality
* An overview of the technology stack to be used
* Documentation of core components, protocols, architecture etc. to be deployed
* PoC/MVP or other relevant prior work or research on the topic

### Ecosystem Fit 
JustEat, UberEat are non blockchain application which are the very businesses we intend to take on.
